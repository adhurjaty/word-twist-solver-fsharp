# Word Twist Solver

This is a basic project for me to try to learn F#. I've actually never played this game, just seemed like a pretty simple game to write a solver for. If you've happened to come across this repo and know F#, please give me some feedback on ways I could make the code clearer, more efficient or more idiomatic
